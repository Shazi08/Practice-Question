#Explain in your own words how Python code is executed.


#You write instructions in a .py file using Python syntax.
#Example: print("Hello world")
#Python interpreter reads the code
#Interpreter converts your into bytecode 
#Python Virtual Machine takes the bytecode and execute it line by line
#If You have Libraries in your program than python loads them and execute the code
#If your code is correct than you see the Output Othervise compiler gives you an error according to your mistake
